If you need to test organizer features, we can make you an assistant organizer for a while. Let's not use this for discussion since people will be testing and most of us will have the e-mail notifications turned off. The Meetup API mailing list is still the best place for that: http://groups.google.com/group/meetup-api/topics</p>",

Anybody with an interest in Java is encouraged to join. We meet once a month. The meetings will include tech talks on various topics related to Java. In addition to the meetings, we plan to have code jams, workshops and bof sessions on a regular basis. Come, connect and collaborate at the <a href="https://bojug.dev.java.net/" target="_blank">BOJUG home page</a> &amp; the <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/bojug" target="_blank">mailing list</a> and be a part of something awesome.<br> <br> We are a group of Java developers in Bangalore, engineers (to say the least) we hope to create a thriving Java community in Bangalore. Java being open sourced is easily one of the greatest piece of news in recent memory for us developers. Now, Java will be adopted even more widely than it was. Part of being open source means to build communities. Communities of developers, users, experts and beginners, which are needed for the greater adoption of Java. These communities are the life-line of any open source product, and as users, it is our responsibility to strengthen Java's life-line</p>",
